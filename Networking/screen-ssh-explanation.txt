#GNU Screen Setup and guide thru

		What Is Linux Screen?
		
	Linux Screen is a command-line utility for creating and managing multiple Terminal sessions.
	It lets you create a virtual shell whose process remains running even after the user disconnects from the server.
	With Screen, VPS users can leave an SSH session and continue where they left off.
	It is available in most Linux distributions, including Debian and RHEL-based operating systems.

	INSTALL SCREEN WITH $sudo apt-get install screen

(USE the down settings on your main-laptop, or if you prefer a other)
Step 1. You need to have a ssh server running follow the upcoming commands if needed
		$sudo apt-get update
		$sudo apt-get install openssh-server
 -	Now check if the server is operating
		$sudo systemctl status ssh
 -	You'll need to see something like
		Active: active (running)
	If not then start it with
		$sudo systemctl start ssh
	If you want the server to automaticly start after a reboot?
		$sudo systemctl enable ssh
 -	Now search the IP-address of the ssh-server
		$ip a
	Look for something like inet 192.168.x.x beneath your active network interface (for example wlan0 or eth0) For example:
		inet 192.168.1.42/24
	This is the IP address you'll need to connect

 -	Mow make a connection from a second laptop using ssh
		$ssh <username>@192.168.1.42

!You'll get a warning at the first time ("Are you sure you want to continue connecting?")
--> type yes. After you are asked a password of that user.

If that succeeded, you'll have a fully completed shell of the other laptop on your terminal.

#Now you combine this with GNU Screen

IF you now use $screen -S  sessie, on your SSH-server running laptop,
And you type $ssh <username>192.168.1.42
			 $screen -x sessie

You will now share a realtime on screen


<!>EXTRA: MAKE SSH MORE SECURE(For later)
If in the furute you want to acces via internet/

 * CHange the port number in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

 * Disable Password-Login and start working with SSH-Keys

 *Use software(fail2ban or ufw) (firewall)
